# [LeetCode- 27. Remove Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element)
## Problem Description
#### Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

#### Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

- #### Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
- #### Return k.
